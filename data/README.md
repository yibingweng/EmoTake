Data description:

Au: Action Units

Bp: Body Posture

Em: Eye movements

Hp: Head Posture


We use the tool to extract the features from our collection video to facilitate the processing. The action units, head postures, and eye movements are extracted by Openface 2.0, and Openpose extracts the body postures. 

Each modality includes 195 samples (we collate our dataset again, and finally choose 24 participants' data (24 people * 3 times * 4 quadrants), and delete the data located in the axis).
